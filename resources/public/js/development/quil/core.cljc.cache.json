Perlin\n  noise is a random sequence generator producing a more natural\n  ordered, harmonic succession of numbers compared to the standard\n  random function. It was invented by Ken Perlin in the 1980s and\n  been used since in graphical applications to produce procedural\n  textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.\n\n  The main difference to the random function is that Perlin noise is\n  defined in an infinite n-dimensional space where each pair of\n  coordinates corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed only for\n  the lifespan of the program). The resulting value will always be\n  between 0.0 and 1.0. Processing can compute 1D, 2D and 3D noise,\n  depending on the number of coordinates given. The noise value can be\n  animated by moving through the noise space and the 2nd and 3rd\n  dimensions can also be interpreted as time.\n\n  The actual noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in\n  respect to the function's use of frequencies.
